# databases_class
final project for databases class

Generated text files containing manual sql imports for random inventory data generated and data pulled from SUSE/Redhat Security Advisory sites/api.
All data ETLed to generate those sql files on the go.

This script can be repurposed and reused without permission, however SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY ACADEMIC PURPOSES.
CHEATING WILL GET YOU NOWHERE.

Thanks!
